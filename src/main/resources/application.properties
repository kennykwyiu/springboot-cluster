# Spring Boot Cluster Application Base Configuration
# This file contains the default and common configurations for all nodes in the cluster.

# Spring Application Name
# Used to identify the application within the Spring ecosystem and for logging.
spring.application.name=springboot-cluster

# Server Configuration
# Defines how the embedded web server (Tomcat by default) behaves.
server.address=0.0.0.0 # Binds the server to all available network interfaces, making it accessible externally.
server.port=8080 # Default port for the application. Overridden by node-specific configurations.

# Session Configuration
# Settings for HTTP session management.
server.servlet.session.timeout=30m # Sets the session timeout to 30 minutes.
server.servlet.session.cookie.name=CLUSTERSESSIONID # Custom name for the session cookie. Important for sticky sessions with Apache.
server.servlet.session.cookie.http-only=true # Prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, enhancing security.
server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=false # Set to true if using HTTPS. For this example, it's false as Apache handles SSL.
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=lax # Provides protection against CSRF attacks by controlling when cookies are sent with cross-site requests.

# Hazelcast Configuration
# Core settings for the Hazelcast cluster used for session sharing.
hazelcast.cluster.name=spring-boot-cluster # Name of the Hazelcast cluster. All members must have the same name to join.
hazelcast.network.port=5701 # Default starting port for Hazelcast communication. Node-specific configs will override.
hazelcast.network.port-auto-increment=true # Allows Hazelcast to try the next available port if the default is in use.
hazelcast.network.members=127.0.0.1:5701,127.0.0.1:5702 # List of known cluster members for TCP/IP discovery. Crucial for cluster formation.

# Actuator Configuration
# Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage the application.
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,hazelcast # Exposes specific Actuator endpoints via HTTP.
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always # Shows full details for the health endpoint.
management.info.env.enabled=true # Enables exposure of environment information via the /info endpoint.

# Logging Configuration
# Defines the logging levels for different packages.
logging.level.com.hazelcast=INFO # Sets logging level for Hazelcast to INFO.
logging.level.com.example.cluster=DEBUG # Sets logging level for application-specific classes to DEBUG for detailed output.
logging.level.org.springframework.session=DEBUG # Sets logging level for Spring Session to DEBUG.

# Application Info
# Information about the application, typically populated from Maven project properties.
info.app.name=@project.name@ # Application name from pom.xml.
info.app.description=@project.description@ # Application description from pom.xml.
info.app.version=@project.version@ # Application version from pom.xml.
info.app.encoding=@project.build.sourceEncoding@ # Source code encoding.
